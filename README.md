# Seattle Mobility Index

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uwescience/seamo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uwescience/seamo)

### Seattle Mobility Index

The Seattle Mobility Index Project measures transportation mode choice, affordability, and reliability at 481 Census Block Groups in Seattle. The project is a low-cost, granular approach to understanding, measuring and communicating mobility.

The Seattle Mobility Indices are based on the ability to reach a market basket of destinations derived from actual travel patterns, not solely on locations nearby.
