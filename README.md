# Seattle Mobility Index


### Seattle Mobility Index

The Seattle Mobility Index Project measures transportation mode choice, affordability, and reliability at 481 Census Block Groups in Seattle. The project is a low-cost, granular approach to understanding, measuring and communicating mobility.

The Seattle Mobility Indices are based on the ability to reach a market basket of destinations derived from actual travel patterns, not solely on locations nearby. 

### Objectives/Goals

1. Market Basket of Destinations. We identified a market basket of destinations that include collections of trips to local destinations, nearby points of interest, and city-wide destination, activity centers that are specific to each origin. 

2. Mobility Indices. We analyze travel from each Census Block Group to the Block Groupâ€™s basket of destinations and developed algorithms that return the following indices:
   - Mode Choice: the number of modes available to reach the basket of destinations from each origin to reach the basket of travel destinations, within a duration threshold. 
   - Affordability: the average cost to reach the basket of travel destinations.
   - Reliability: the percentage of trips below the 85th percentile of travel duration. Travel time reliability algorithms will be applied to data that has been collected over a period of time.

3. Mode Share Predictions. We predict the probability a traveler will use a single occupancy vehicle and other modes given the Mode Choice and Affordability scores for their location.
